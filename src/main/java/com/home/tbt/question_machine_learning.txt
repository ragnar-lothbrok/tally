Given a square matrix of alphabets which contain English letters in arbitrary manner. While searching a word in it, you can go left to right horizontally, vertically downwards or diagonally towards left (both upwards and downwards).
 
You have to find the number of matches of a given word in the matrix.

For example, In the given square matrix {A#A#K,A#S#K,A#K#K},
                                                            
                                                                                                                                             
The word "ASK"  is matched four times in the input matrix. So the output will be 4.


Input/Output Specifications Input:
i)  Size of the square matrix {N: integer} (1<=N<=50)
ii) An array of string {N strings containing N uppercase alphabets separated by #}
iii) String (Word to be searched) 

Output: 
Number of occurrences of the word in the matrix {an integer}

ExamplesExample1 :
Input1(Size of matrix): 2
Input2(Matrix): {A#S,S#T} 
Input3(Word): AS
Output: 2

Example2:
Input1(Size of matrix): 5
Input2(Matrix): {E#D#E#E#E,D#I#S#K#E,E#S#E#E#E,E#C#E#E#E,E#E#E#E#E} 
Input3(Word): DISK
Output: 1

Explanation: 
In this example, "DISK"  is matched only one time in the input matrix. So the output will be 1.
